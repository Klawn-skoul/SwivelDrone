Ufinished mini game

It's a mini game that I made a long time ago and it took me about a week and a half, in the second year of the programming and video game course. It's not finished but I think it's a pretty funny mechanic in terms of difficulty, but once you learn to move it's satisfying.

It only works on Windows OS and does not have a keyboard, specifically the left and right arrows.

* **Right arrow** right engine.
* **Left arrow** left engine.
* In case you get stuck in a corner, if you hold the **Space** for a while, it will jump out and you can try to move.
